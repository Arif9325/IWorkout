##### Note: 
When the user makes a login/sign-up request, the app sends a POST or GET request to the database to log the user in or create an account.

#### Home Page
After logging in or signing up, the user is redirected to the home screen, which displays their user information along with buttons to the workout logger and the workout viewer pages.
