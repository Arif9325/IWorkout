### Description
A workout tracking app designed to help users create and manage their workout routines easily.

### How It Works

#### Login
The app starts on a login page where the user can log in to their account.

#### Sign Up
If the user does not already have an account, they can navigate to the sign-up page to create one. After successfully signing up, the user is redirected back to the login page to log in with their newly created account.

#### Home Page
After logging in, the user is authenticated and directed to the home page, which greets them with their name (e.g., "Hello, [User]!").  
From the home page, the user can:
 **Log out**
 **Chat with the AI**
 **Add a workout**
 **View their workout routines**

#### Workout Planner
Users can add workouts to specific days of the week (Monday to Sunday). They can:
 Choose a day for the workout.
 Add multiple workouts to a single day.  

This allows the user to build a detailed workout routine.

#### View Workouts
In the "View Workouts" section, the user can:
 Select a specific day to view all workouts for that day.
 Edit or delete workouts if needed.  

This section gives the user full control over their workout routines.
